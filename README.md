# Music Pro

The goal of this project is to create a responsive website for a music shop. The site is targeted both towards musicians and people who are buying an instrument for the first time. It will provide useful information for all the questions a customer might have.
## User Goals
1. Repair an instrument
2. Buy a new instrument
3. Get information about opening hours
4. Get information about location
5. Get contact information
6. Contact the shop via form
7. Stay informed through a newsletter
## User Stories
1. "As a professional musician i needed someon to repair my instrument, thanks to the music pro site it was easy to see that they offered this service and to arrange it by using the contact information"
2. "As a first time buyer I wanted to buy an instrument for my son, but i wasn't sure where to start. On the Music Pro website if saw that they offer advice for people who are buying an instrument for the first time, so i was convinced to visit the shop"
3. "As an interested musician I knew about Music Pro but i wasn't sure how to get there, so it was very convenient to see the Google Maps position and the directions on their site."
4. "As a potential client before deciding to visit their shop, i wanted to know a bit more about it and its owners. Thanks to the gallery i got to see who they were and learned more about the history of Music Pro"
5. "As an occasional customer I just needed to check Music Pro's opening times to see if i was still in time to get there. That information was easy to find on the site"
6. "As a regular customer I wanted a way to stay alerted about all offers Music Pro might have, so i subscribed to their newsletter"
7. "As a buyer, thanks to their intuitive site it was easy to find and order the product i needed."
## Site Owner Goals
1. To have an appealing and friendly-looking site
2. To have all the most important information about the shop easily accessible (address, contact information, directions)
3. Give the user an immediate idea of what services we offer
4. Present our products in a way that is easy to navigate and intuitive
5. Have a site that is modern and responsive on all devices

## Design Choices
My goal was to create a simple, clean-looking site, that still could have its own character and stand out between other similar sites. 
## Colors
I selected three colors and tried to use all of them sparingly so as to not overwhelm the user and keep the site clean. The main colors are gold and black. Gold is a warm and elegant color and black is simple and elegant. Header and footer are gold on each page, and almost all fonts are black. The pictures on the homepage-carousel all have black as their main-color, and the same goes for the pictures on the About Us page. On the instrument page there is a second nav bar where i inverted the colors from the main nav bar: the background-color is black and the font-color is gold. This creates a nice contrast. To give them a bit more emphasis, i also gave all buttons a golden background-color. I have used a third color but very sparingly: chocolate. I used it only to give certain elements even more emphasis than usual. I used chocolate as a border-color for the links in the main nav bar when the user hovers over them. I also used it for the names of the instrument category, to make it more intuitive where one category ends and another one begins.
## Fonts
I used Zen Dots for the logo and the lato font for the body of my page. Zen Dots is a very particular font that makes the logo stand out, but it wouldn't be very legible if the entire page was in this font. Lato is perfect for the body, as it is a well readable sans-serif font.
## Structure
The first thing that should jump to the user's attention should be the logo, that's why i i placed it in the top left corner, larger than the rest of the text and with a particular font (zen dots).

After that, there is the navigation menu in the following order: Home, Instruments, About Us, Contact Us and Newsletter.
On the homepage there is some essential information about the shop Music Pro: first of all a nice hero image that gives an immediate sense of what the site is about. 
Immediately below, the user will find more information about what services and type of products the shop offers.
Finally, there are a map of where to find the shop and the opening hours. These are probably the information which should be the fastest to find: i can imagine that a user might just come onto the site to check the opening hours or the location of the shop. 
Next on the nav  bar is the core of the site: the instrument selection. All instruments can be browsed on this site, and there is a second nav bar which allows the user to quickly jump to the category they want.  
Each instrument has its name, the price, some essential information and a buy button.
The third link on the nav bar brings the user to the About Us page: This is where they can learn more about the shop and its founders. It gives the site a more human aspect and makes it more relatable.
Finally, in the contact page the user can find all the relevant information for contacting the shop and a form for any queries.

## Wireframes
I used balsamiq for the wireframes. Since some aspects of the project changed while i was making it, i created an updated wireframe to make sure it reflected the site accurately.

## Features
### Existing features

- Nav Bar
   Featured on all the pages of the site, the responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, About Us and Contact Us page and is identical in each page in order to make the navigation easy.
   This allows the user to easily reach every page without having to resort to the "back" button. ![nav-bar](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/Navbar.png?raw=true)  
   The nav bar is responsive and will transform into a hamburger menu on smaller screen sizes.

- Home page hero image
   This hero image contains a beautiful image of a guitar on fire. ![hero-image](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/hero-image.png?raw=true)  

- Home page description section
   This section explains the user what exactly the shop offers. It gives precise information about what the user can expect to find at the shop or in the page.![description](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/description.png?raw=true)  

- Opening hours and Google Maps iframe
   This section give the user vital information: when the shop is open and a direct link to google maps. This makes it easy for the user to get directions. ![opening-hours](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/openinghours-map.png?raw=true)  

- Footer
   The footer contains direct links to social media sites. This encourages the user to interact with the shop through these sites. ![footer](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/footer.png)

- Instruments navigation bar
   On this page, the user can scroll freely through all the available products, but the instruments navigation bar is very useful because it allows the user to jump to any category in the page. ![instrument-navbar](https://github.com/Damianjacob/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/blob/master/assets/images/readme-images/instruments-navbar.png?raw=true)  
   The instruments nav bar is responsive and will become vertical and move to the side on smaller screen sizes.

### ACCESSIBILITY
There is one error because of an empty form label on index.html, however i need that label to stay empty for my responsive nav bar to show correctly as a hamburger menu.  The same goes for the instruments.html page in the buy modal: there are empty labels because i used icons from font awesome for those labels.
### LIGHTHOUSE
All of the pages in this site have achieved a score over 90 in performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.

### Fixed errors
There have been some errors which i needed to fix:
- HTML: I had used the same id for multiple elements on the instrument page. Both were related to the modal forms: i had used id=fname and id=lname in both modals. I fixed this by renaming the elements in the buy modal and pointing their labels accordingly.
- CSS: I had mistakenly used the rule "background-repeat: no" for 4 different background images. This is incorrect and i changed it to "background-repeat: no-repeat".
- Accessibility: The newsletter button had a low contrast error, so i changed its color in order to obtain a better contrast.
- Lighthouse: the performance of my site was suffering because i had used high-resolution images with a width of around 4000px. I reduced all images with a free online resource (https://www.befunky.com/features/resize-image/) to slightly above their max-width. This allowed my performace to reach a score of over 90.

## Bugs

The hardest bug to resolve was with the grid elements on the about-us.html and contact-us.html pages: once the viewport dropped below 800px (which is my breakpoint for tablets and mobile phones), the grid element overflowed to the right. It was very time consuming to try to figure out what the problem was, and once i discovered that it was overflowing thanks to the help of our tutor support, i tried changing the space and height rules with CSS. This still did not help, so i decided to set the display of the grid container to absolute and position it on the page. This created another bug: when reducing the height of the viewport, some of the content would overlap. I resolved this problem partially by changing the min-height from "100vh" to a set amount of px. There is still a part in my about-us page where the content overflows slightly over the background image at the very bottom (only with smaller screen sizes).

## Deployment
The site was deployed to Github pages. See the live link: https://damianjacob.github.io/CI_MS1_Music_Pro/index.html

### Content
   I took used the modal bootstrap from https://getbootstrap.com/ and followed the documentation from that site to modify the code of the bootstrap. I often referred back to various lessons from Code Institute and to W3schools or MDN.
   For the responsive nav bar using only CSS i followed this tutorial by Kevin Powell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA

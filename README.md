# Music Pro

The goal of this project is to create a responsive website for a music shop. The site is targeted both towards musicians and people who are buying an instrument for the first time. It will provide useful information for all the questions a customer might have.
## User Goals
1. Repair an instrument
2. Buy a new instrument
3.

##User Requirements and Expectations

## Design Choices
My goal was to create a simple, clean-looking site, that still could have its own character and stand out between other similar sites. 
## Colors
I selected three colors and tried to use all of them sparingly so as to not overwhelm the user and keep the site clean. The main colors are gold and black. Gold is a warm and elegant color and black is simple and elegant. Header and footer are gold on each page, and almost all fonts are black. The pictures on the homepage-carousel all have black as their main-color, and the same goes for the pictures on the About Us page. On the instrument page there is a second nav bar where i inverted the colors from the main nav bar: the background-color is black and the font-color is gold. This creates a nice contrast. To give them a bit more emphasis, i also gave all buttons a golden background-color. I have used a third color but very sparingly: chocolate. I used it only to give certain elements even more emphasis than usual. I used chocolate as a border-color for the links in the main nav bar when the user hovers over them. I also used it for the names of the instrument category, to make it more intuitive where one category ends and another one begins.
## Fonts
I used Zen Dots for the logo and the lato font for the body of my page. Zen Dots is a very particular font that makes the logo stand out, but it wouldn't be very legible if the entire page was in this font. Lato is perfect for the body, as it is a well readable sans-serif font.
## Structure
The first thing that should jump to the user's attention should be the logo, that's why i i placed it in the top left corner, larger than the rest of the text and with a particular font. After that, there is the navigation menu in the following order: Home, Instruments, About Us, Contact Us and Newsletter.
On the homepage there is some essential information about the shop Music Pro: first of all a carousel with nice pictures of instruments that give an immediate sense of what the site is about. Immediately below, the user will find more information about what services and type of products the shop offers. Finally, there are a map of where to find the shop and the opening hours. These are probably the information which should be the fastest to find: i can imagine that a user might just come onto the site to check the opening hours or the location of the shop. Next on the nav  bar is the core of the site: the instrument selection. All instruments can be browsed on this site, and there is a second nav bar which allows the user to quickly jump to the category they want. Each instrument has its name, the price, some essential information and a buy button.
The third link on the nav bar brings the user to the About Us page: This is where they can learn more about the shop and its founders. It gives the site a more human aspect and makes it more reliable. Finally, in the contact page the user can find all the relevant information for contacting the shop and a form for any queries.
## Wireframes
I used balsamiq for the wireframes. My original idea of the site looks a bit different from what it actually became: i did not use a "more info" button for the instruments. I also changed my mind about the "About Us" page: instead of creating a grid with a mix of images and text, i placed a few paragraphs with background-images as i liked tha idea better. I did not put a "contact us" link to a modal in the footer because i realized it would be nicer for the user to see the link immediately in the nav bar instead of having to search for it. I also delete the payment options from the footer because that looked too cluttered.
